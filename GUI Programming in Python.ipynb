    "Graphical User Interface(GUI) are a type of human-computer interfaces, which allows the user to give commands to the computer by manipulating graphical components which are displayed on the screen.    \n",
    "\n",
    "GUI's are a replacement, improvement(although some would disagree) over other mechanisms for giving commands to computer such as Text based user interfaces(TUI), Command Line Interfaces(CLI).        \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be argued that GUI's were one of the main reasons for wide spread adoption of computers as it reduced the apparent complexity of computers and made it much simpler for new users to get up and running with their systems and get to solving the problem they faced, rather than dealing with the idiosyncrasies of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of GUI\n",
    "\n",
    "* Much simpler to get started with a new system, as GUI's are usually designed to be intutive and easy to use.\n",
    "* Are generally the most natural way to interact with certain kind of applications (Such as paint, engineering drawing applications etc.)\n",
    "* Helps the user focus on the work at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Side Note on CLI's\n",
    "\n",
    "CLI's are not bad, in fact they are the preferred way to do a lot of administrative tasks. What they lack in eye-candy (which a lot of upcoming CLI programs don't) they make up for them in elegance, power and a lot of additional capabilities such as scripting, scheduling etc."

    "\n",
    "A GUI Program is quite different from traditional Console based programs in that they don't necessarily follow a linear sequence of execution.         \n",
    "\n",
    "Since GUI's need to respond to user events which can occur asynchronously, this necessitates that the program paradigm be also responsive to the events. This paradigm of programming is commonly referred to as *event-driven programming*.\n",

    "\n",
    "The GUI Library usually provides with the event manager, and an inital building blocks of Widgets. Thus the main job in building a GUI Program is to combine the widgets in meaningful ways and crearing the methods and classes to provide required functionalites when the widgets are used in a certain way."

    "# Python and GUI Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The most standard way to create GUI Applications in Python is to use one of the many packages such as `tkinter`, `pyQt`,  `wxPython`, `pyGtk`, which provide bindings to GUI libraries written in other languages. (So technically when you call methods from one of these modules, it calls the underlying code of the GUI library which is written in different language. Refer this [StackOverflow link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1475637/how-do-you-bind-a-language-python-for-example-to-another-say-c) for additional information regarding this binding mechanism).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's standard library comes with Tcl/Tk. Tcl is a scripting language and Tk is a GUI library written using Tcl and C. Python's `tkinter` module provides bindings for the Tk GUI library.           \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations of using Tk such as:         \n",
    "* Tk doesn't provide any direct way of creating custom widgets from scratch wherein you get to specify pixel-by-pixel what you want. Although you can still create custom widgets, by combining other widgets.       \n",
    "* Some Additional Tk widgets are availble using the Ttk library which is present only with Python 3.1 and Tk 8.5+ and the Tix library which is not provided by default on all systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with all of these limitations, the `tkinter` is the most preferred and logical option if you want to develop cross-platform GUI application, with no additional installations, simply because it comes with all standard installation of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other alternatives can be divided into 2 types.         \n",
    "1. __Platform specific__ in which you access the raw graphics library of the underlying system, this option has the advantage that you can end up with extremely native looking overall application and you also have the maximum freedom in dictating the look and feel of your applications (You can also go full metal, and build your Application by using OpenGL bindings from PyOpenGL or something like that)        \n",
    "2. __Cross Platform__, which are similar to `tkinter`'s binding to Tk. `pyQt` is one of the alternative, but has a weird licensing issue, which needs to be grokked completely before building commercial applications out of it. Other alternatives are `wxPython` and `pyGtk`.             "
